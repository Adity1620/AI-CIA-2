# Break down the code into logical steps that describe how the inputs are transformed into the output. For example, the steps are:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2. Loop through all pairs of adjacent prompts in the input list.
3. Loop through all possible substrings of the specified length in each pair of prompts.
4. Check if the substrings are equal. If yes, combine the prompts by appending the second prompt after the common substring and add the resulting string to the output list.
5. Repeat this process for all specified lengths.
6. Return the output list.
