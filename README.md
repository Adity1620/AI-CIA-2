# Break down the code into logical steps that describe how the inputs are transformed into the output. For example, the steps are:
# Initialize an empty list to store the result.
# Loop through all pairs of adjacent prompts in the input list.
# Loop through all possible substrings of the specified length in each pair of prompts.
# Check if the substrings are equal. If yes, combine the prompts by appending the second prompt after the common substring and add the resulting string to the output list.
# Repeat this process for all specified lengths.
# Return the output list.
